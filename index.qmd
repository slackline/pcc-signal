- Privately owned by Meta
- For profit (if not paying **you** are the product)
- Messages end-to-end encrypted but "metadata" isn't
- Code base is closed source (no scrutiny)
- WhatsAppp shares **all** your contacts with Meta
- **Excludes** those who _are_ concerned about privacy

## Challenges to Switching

- No "community" feature in Signal
- "_I've nothing to hide_"
- Network Effect

## No Community Feature

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Problem

- No "Community" feature

:::
::: {.column width=50%}

#### Solution

- Group chats have individual managers
- New members are told about all groups and contact manager to sign up

:::
::::

## I've Nothing to Hide {.scrollable}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Problem

- Some people don't care about being tracked
- Privacy should be default (but it's not üòí )

:::
::: {.column width=50%}

#### Solution

- Not hiding, right to privacy ([Article 12 UN Declaration of Human
  Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights))
- Use of WhatsApp affects your contacts
- If not bothered switching to privacy respecting tools shouldn't be a problem

:::
::::

## Network Effect

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Problem

- Resistance to change
- "_Not another app!_"
- No one uses it
- Two concurrent systems

:::
::: {.column width=50%}

#### Solution

- Already have lots
- Could be a dedicated "PCC" messaging app
- Either...
  - Switch & close down WhatsApp community
  - Don't switch
